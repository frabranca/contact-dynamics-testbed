## Time Matching Method

After recording the timings for each of the components, the starting time for the robot and the gripper can be tweaked based on the satellite time, so that the robot can reach the contact point in time. Note that the grasping has to occur when the motor is turned off and the satellite is spinning by inertia and decelerating. This means that, depending on inaccuracies of the satellite starting position the satellite will not always be grabbed at the exact same speed and/or position.
